# Final-Project-Assignment-Due-Dates
This is the Final Project For CIT-245 at CCAC. What my program does is that it inserts, deletes, and views assignments and the due dates. It can proove
to be useful when keeping track on all assignments. This Program helped me learn and understand the fundamentals of maps. 


## DefaultAssignments()
This function views the entire default assignments and their due dates. This also loads onto the CurrentAssignments Function. This could be useful if
the program doesn't currently have any assignments in the CurrentAssignments function.

## CurrentAssignments()
Stores all of the Assignments that are loaded from the DefaultAssignments(), but also any other assignments that were inserted and/or deleted by the
user. This can be viewed any time at the main menu.

## InsertNewAssignments()
Allows the user to insert any new assignments to the program. It will what the assignment name is and what the due date will be for the assignment.

## RemoveAssignments()
Allows the user to remove assignments. All that the user has to do is type that name of the assignment and it should remove the assignment

## ExitProgram()
This function simply exits the program and returns a 0 depending if you are
compiling it in an IDE like Netbeans or Eclipse.
